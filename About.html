        <h2><em>About:</em></h2>
        <h3>
            At Port Orchard Seventh-day Adventist Church, we believe Jesus provides hope in a broken world. We aren't
            perfect, but our lives are being changed by Jesus' love and grace. We want to have a total commitment to
            Jesus and the mission He has given us. We want to invite everyone in the Kitsap area (and beyond) to accept
            Jesus as their Savior and Lord, embrace all Bible truth, and join a worldwide movement of people joyfully
            awaiting Jesus' soon return (John 3:16; 2 Timothy 3:16; Revelation 14:12; Titus 2:13).
        </h3>
        <h2><em>Our Mission:</em></h2>
        <h3>
            As a Christ centered family, empowered by God's Spirit, we lovingly accept everyone where they are, in
            knowing, living and growing in Jesus, and together we enjoy that experience and encourage others to
            celebrate with us anticipating His soon return.
        </h3>
