        <h2>Visit Us</h2>
        <section id="Top">
            <h3>Visiting</h3>
            <p>We understand that visiting a church can be a daunting experience. Perhaps you haven’t been for 
                awhile, perhaps you’ve never been at all, perhaps you are just in town temporarily… Whatever 
                your background, come as you are and be accepted. The Port Orchard Seventh-day Adventist Church 
                has the privilege of welcoming first time visitors every Sabbath. We believe that you even 
                thinking about visiting is evidence that God is working in your life, and we want to help you 
                connect with Him.
            </p>

        <section id="Location">
            <h3>Where are you located?</h3>
            <p>Across the street from Fred Meyer on Bethel Rd.
            </p>
            <p>Address: 5000 Bethel Rd., Port Orchard, WA 98367.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Expectations">
            <h3>What should I expect?</h3>
            <p>We gather together every Saturday to worship God, encourage each other and experience Jesus’ hope that we
                can share with others throughout the week. When you walk in the door, a friendly greeter will meet you
                with a warm handshake and a bulletin. People will be interested to meet you and help make your
                experience as meaningful as possible. We hope you will fill out a blue Contact Card, so we can continue
                to stay in touch and serve you in your journey with Jesus.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Worship-Service">
            <h3>What is the worship service like?</h3>
            <p>A typical service includes singing (sometimes hymns; sometimes contemporary songs), prayer, children’s
                story,
                Bible reading, and a 30-minute hope-filled Bible message. You will find kind people in a relaxed
                atmosphere
                with a serious faith. It’s not fancy, it’s family.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Clothes">
            <h3>What do I wear?</h3>
            <p>There is no dress code that we adhere to. Most people attend wearing business-casual attire; some wear
                suits, ties and dresses and others wear jeans or shorts. Our primary focus is not on externals, but on
                opening our hearts to God.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Time">
            <h3>What time is church?</h3>
            <p>Saturdays at 9:30am we offer Bible study groups for all ages. One of the friendly greeters in the lobby
                can help you find a welcoming group to join.
                Saturdays at 11:00am the worship service begins in the sanctuary and lasts about 80 minutes.
            </p>

        <section id="Food">
            <h3>When is there food?</h3>
            <p>On the first Saturday of each month a “potluck” lunch is provided. Plan to enjoy good food and meet new
                friends.
