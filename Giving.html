        <h2><em>Why do we give?</em></h2>
        <h3>
            The Bible teaches us that when we put God first in our finances, He takes care of us. Everything belongs to
            God. He is a generous Giver to us. He gave His Son for us. He has given us everything we have. He invites us
            to trust Him with everything, including our finances.

            We can’t out-give God. We believe giving through the local and world Seventh-day Adventist church has
            radical potential to bring transformation and hope to our community and our world.

        </a>
        </button>
        <h3>
            Since you’re already online, you can give conveniently and securely through a service called Adventist
            Giving (click the button above).
            Using this service is free to you and the church. You will need to set up an account (one time) with a
            username and password. There is an online offering envelope that you fill out each time you give and then
            your debit/credit card or electronic check is processed.
        </h3>
        <h2><em>Give at Church</em></h2>
        <h3>You have an opportunity to give during the worship service each Sabbath. By using a Tithe & Offering
            Envelope located in seatbacks in the sanctuary, you can indicate where you would like the money to go
            (i.e. Tithe, Local Church Budget/Ministries, etc.). Contributions are tax deductible and you will be
            mailed a receipt at the end of each year.
            If you miss the offering collection time, you can drop off your Tithe and Offering Envelope to the
            pastor’s office anytime to be passed on to the treasury team.
            Offerings given each Sabbath that are not enclosed in Tithe & Offering Envelopes are allocated on a
            rotating basis to ministries locally, regionally and around the world.
        </h3>
        <h2><em>Give by Mail</em></h2>
        <h3>
        You can even mail us your tithes and offerings. If you would like an offering envelope, just let us know. Or
        simply write a note letting us know how you want your offering divided. Simply make your check out to Port
        Orchard Seventh-day Adventist Church and mail it to:

        <h2><em>What does God ask us to give?</em></h2>
        <h3><em>Tithe (10%)</em> - God requires everyone to return 10% (tithe) of our increase to Him 
            through His church. This grows our TRUST in God and helps protect us from greed and selfishness. 
            Tithe helps send pastors, teachers, health workers and missionaries to share hope all over the world.
        </h3>
        <h3><em>Offerings (any amount in addition)</em> -God invites us to return offerings according to how 
            much we have been blessed. Offerings grow our LOVE for God. Offerings make a difference wherever 
            you choose to give: locally, regionally or around the world. We believe that the more we invest in 
            God’s work, especially where we live, the more we see God multiply our joy.

<!-- What are my options? 
So Right now I've made an About, Connect, and Community
button, but connect and community seem redundent. 

I'm going to be talking about VBS. Kids Kloset. 
The Current Pastor. Referencing Youtube Sermons. 
Bible Studies. Helpline. Coffee Oasis. Beliefs. 
Online giving of money. The facebook pages. 
Making floating Youtube and Facebook buttons. 

I'd like to incorporate ways for people to learn how
to join the church directory. 

Maybe I could make a public facing site and an 
in-network site that has features to help people connect
more directly with members.
