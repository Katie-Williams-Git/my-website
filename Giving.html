<!-- What are my options? 
So Right now I've made an About, Connect, and Community
button, but connect and community seem redundent. 

I'm going to be talking about VBS. Kids Kloset. 
The Current Pastor. Referencing Youtube Sermons. 
Bible Studies. Helpline. Coffee Oasis. Beliefs. 
Online giving of money. The facebook pages. 
Making floating Youtube and Facebook buttons. 

I'd like to incorporate ways for people to learn how
to join the church directory. 

Maybe I could make a public facing site and an 
in-network site that has features to help people connect
more directly with members.
